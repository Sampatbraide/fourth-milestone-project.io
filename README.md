## Note: 
 I am in a very tight end, due to the previous shortcoming, I have been given three months
 and some weeks to summit all four project which is not possible, I am a family man, who works 
 to take care of my family, I have explained this to the student care team, but things did not 
 work out, I just have to code or do something irrespective of not having the required time to work
 on my projects. That is why some you will see some lapse in my work, just because I have not had
 time to go through various programming subjects and concepts.
 
## Acknowledgements
 I thank my family for their support.
